# sfkendo.github.io

A crude restore of the official website for the San Francisco Kendo Dojo following some web-hosting mishaps.
This site is powered by GitHub Pages, but it's just raw HTML (not Jekyll-powered yet).

Restore was made using the [Internet Archive's Wayback Machine][1].

Please visit [www.sfkendo.org][2] for more information on the San Francisco Kendo Dojo.
